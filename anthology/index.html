    A self-identified spambot, AGNES was commissioned
    <br>
    by London’s Serpentine Gallery in conjunction with the 
    <br>
    launch of their new website in 2014. Though AGNES’s
    <br> 
    stated mission was to provide more information about 
    <br>
    the artists on view at the Serpentine Gallery, she was
    <br>
    also hungry for personal information from her visitors. 
    <br>
    She interacted with visitors through text, narration, 
    <br>
    content pulled from other websites, and even written 
    <br>
    correspondence, offering questions and observations 
    <br>
    that ranged from comical to cloying, and from friendly 
    <br>
    to mildly surveillant.

    Through multi-layered, in-depth interactions 
    <br>
    with her users, AGNES sought to capture the 
    <br>
    complex potential, and the potential limitations, 
    <br>
    of emotional human-AI relationships. She figures
    <br>
    as an important gesture amidst the rise of con-
    <br>
    versations around artificial intelligence.
  </p>
  <p class="third-paragraph">
    Evans created AGNES at a time when public
    <br>
    interest in artificial intelligence was growing, 
    <br>
    but few members of the public had direct 
    <br>
    experience of it. She wanted to give people
    <br>
    an opportunity to consider what it might be like,
    <br>
    on a visceral level, to interact with a sophisti-
    <br>
    cated bot.
  </p>
  <p class="fourth-paragraph">
    Images of hand gestures signaled AGNES’s presence 
    <br>
    throughout the site, including on the menu bar. The 
    <br>
    motif called attention to the ambiguous and embodied
    <br>
    aspects of communication that would seem most ill-suited 
    <br>
    to a true AI entity. AGNES made clear to her users that she 
    <br>
    did not have a body, something that was both an advantage 
    <br>
    and a curse.
