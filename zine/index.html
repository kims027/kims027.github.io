        <p>“What Age Are You, Really?”, “What City Should You Actually Live In?” and “What Career Should You Actually Have?” are three of our four biggest quizzes. Of course, no one actually believes these quizzes are going to uncover some dark mystery about themselves. The quizzes themselves are designed to be silly in order to attract people who have a little time to kill. Then how does it garner so much attention? What attracts people, especially this generation, to these silly quizzes?</p>
        <p>They catch your attention with two things: a captivating title and an image that calls out to you. Furthermore, viral quizzes allow us to easily categorize ourselves. A recent study conducted by Cigna, a health insurance company, revealed that Generation Z is the loneliest generation and claims to have worse mental health than any other generation surveyed. Part of their success is due to the instant affirmation it provides that we share some similarities with other people. We as humans have an innate desire to learn more about ourselves and these quizzes provided a not-so-serious approach to that.</p>

        <p>Moreover, the fun isn't taking the quiz—it's showing the result to others. By sharing your quiz results on Facebook, it is allowing people to start conversations and compare results. According to Slate.com, “[Buzzfeed quizzes get 75% of their overall traffic from social networks.” Its most popular quiz “What City Should You Actually Live In?” accumulated over 20 million views through the help of social media. Everyone eagerly answered seemingly random questions like “What could you eat forever?” and “What’s your jam?” and got answers that were perfect for sharing.</p>
        <p>The wide ranges of quizzes also provide insight to this generation. Of course, there are silly, carefree quizzes such as “Do You Pronounce These Foods The Same Way As Everyone Else?” and “Which Character From “The Office” Are You?” At the same time, there are quizzes that are on the topic of politics such as “No One Under 25 Can Identify Half Of These Politicians, And No One Under 35 Can Name All Of Them”. The duality of the topics of these quizzes reflects the interests of Generation Z. Though memes and pop culture are of high interest, Generation Z is considered one of the most politically active generations. The political quizzes on Buzzfeed are a piece of how young people are grappling with political divisions at this chaotic moment in history.</p>
        <p>Overall, these quizzes combat the feeling of information overload that is often common in this digital age. One by one, these simple quizzes oversaturate our Facebook feeds and become a source of momentary entertainment. On top of all that, a little time spent digging through Buzzfeed quizzes will reveal so much of Generation Z. It has become a unique platform so catered to younger generations that it has in turn also become a source to understand the interests and fears of this generation.</p>
