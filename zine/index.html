        <p>The concept of alluring quizzes has been in existence for awhile. For example, Cosmopolitan’s relationship quizzes have existed since the ’60s. However, with the combination of today’s technology and heavy social media presence, Buzzfeed quizzes is a product like no other. It has the ability to captivate and attract a diverse range of people who all have different interests and beliefs. Buzzfeed quizzes are a melting pot of different pop references, memes, and early 2000s throwbacks of this generation. Thus, it collectively reveals so much of Generation Z and provides insight into their different personalities.</p>

Of course, no one actually believes these quizzes are going to uncover some dark mystery about themselves. The quizzes themselves are designed to be silly in order to attract people who have a little time to kill. Then how does it garner so much attention? What attracts people, especially this generation, to these silly quizzes?</p>
        <p>They catch your attention with two things: a captivating title and an image that calls out to you. Furthermore, viral quizzes allow us to easily categorize ourselves. A recent study conducted by Cigna, a health insurance company, revealed that Generation Z is the loneliest generation and claims to have worse mental health than any other generation surveyed. Part of their success is due to the instant affirmation it provides that we share some similarities with other people. We as humans have an innate desire to learn more about ourselves and these quizzes provided a not-so-serious approach to that.</p>

        <p>Moreover, the fun isn't taking the quiz—it's showing the result to others. By sharing your quiz results on Facebook, it is allowing people to start conversations and compare results. According to Slate.com, “[Buzzfeed quizzes] get 75% of their overall traffic from social networks.” Its most popular quiz <span><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ashleyperez/what-city-should-you-actually-live-in">“What City Should You Actually Live In?”</a></span> accumulated over 20 million views through the help of social media. Everyone eagerly answered seemingly random questions like “What could you eat forever?” and “What’s your jam?” and got answers that were perfect for sharing.</p>

      <p class="ash"> "I gravitate towards quizzes that are more intimate and deep such as the enneagram and the personality quiz. The character ones would be fun if they had more questions about the character rather than asking random ones such as which soy sauce do you like better."</p>
      <p class="reg"> "I like quizzes that uses questions relevant to the title. It makes it feel like I am taking a legitimate quiz that will give me the most accurate answer. There are quizzes like 'What kind of FRIENDS character are you' but then they ask irrelevant questions, which makes the whole quiz not fun."</p>
      <p class="jus"> "I think the format of the quizzes are already as successful as they can be. As long as Buzzfeed continues to cater towards younger generations and the popular culture of the generation, they’ll continue to find success."</p>

        <p>The wide ranges of quizzes also provide insight to this generation. Of course, there are silly, carefree quizzes such as <span><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/sarahaspler/food-pronounce-quiz">“Do You Pronounce These Foods The Same Way As Everyone Else?”</a></span> and <span><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/anitabadejo/which-character-from-the-office-are-you">“Which Character From “The Office” Are You?”</a></span> At the same time, there are quizzes that are on the topic of politics such as <span><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewziegler/politician-quiz-face">“No One Under 25 Can Identify Half Of These Politicians, And No One Under 35 Can Name All Of Them”</a>.</span> The duality of the topics of these quizzes reflects the interests of Generation Z. Though memes and pop culture are of high interest, Generation Z is considered one of the most politically active generations. The political quizzes on Buzzfeed are a piece of how young people are grappling with political divisions at this chaotic moment in history.</p>
        <p>What once was considered a source of momentary entertainment has developed into Gen Z's own digital time capsule. A little time spent digging through Buzzfeed quizzes will reveal so much of Generation Z. It has become a unique platform so catered to younger generations that it has in turn also become a source to understand the interests and fears of this generation.</p>
